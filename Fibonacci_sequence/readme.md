# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This project contains a JavaScript implementation of a Fibonacci sequence generator.

## Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This generator allows users to input the number of terms they want to generate in the sequence.

## Features

- User input for the number of terms
- Input validation to ensure a positive integer is entered
- Generates and displays the Fibonacci sequence

## How to Use

1. Open the `generator.js` file in a JavaScript environment (e.g., a web browser console or Node.js).
2. Run the script.
3. When prompted, enter the number of terms you want in the Fibonacci sequence.
4. The script will generate and display the sequence.

## File Structure

- `generator.js`: Contains the main function to generate the Fibonacci sequence.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.

## Function Explanation

The `generateFibonacci()` function:
1. Prompts the user for input
2. Validates the input
3. Initializes the first two terms of the sequence
4. Calculates and displays subsequent terms based on the user's input
